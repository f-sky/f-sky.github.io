I obtained my Ph.D. degree in 2024 in Computer Science at
[CAD&CG Lab](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/)
at [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/english/),
supervised by Prof. [Xiaowei Zhou](http://xzhou.me/).

I was previously a visiting Ph.D. student in Computer Science and Engineering
at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/), supervised by
Prof. [Hao Su](http://ai.ucsd.edu/~haosu/).

I received my Bachelor's degree in 2019 in Computer Science and
English (dual-degree) from [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/english/).

I am interested on 3D Computer Vision and Embodied AI. My research focuses on 3D
understanding, including 3D object detection, reconstruction, and generation.

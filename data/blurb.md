I am currently a Ph.D. student in the College of Computer Science & the [State Key Laboratory of CAD&CG](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/) at [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/english/),
supervised by Prof. [Xiaowei Zhou](http://xzhou.me/), and a visiting Ph.D. student in Computer Science and Engineering at [SU Lab](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~haosu/lab/group.html) at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/), supervised by Prof. [Hao Su](http://ai.ucsd.edu/~haosu/).

I received my Bachelor's degree in 2019 in Computer Science and
English (dual-degree) from [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/english/).

I am interested on 3D Computer Vision and Deep Learning. My research focuses on 3D scene
understanding, including 3D object detection and tracking and 3D reconstruction.

{"pageProps":{"title":"Organizing the Geometry Meets Deep Learning Workshop at ICCV 2019.","content":"<p>We have been organizing a series of workshop <em>Geometry Meets Deep Learning</em> (GMDL). This series of workshops was initiated at ECCV 2016. The 4th edition of the GMDL workshop was successfully held at ICCV 2019: <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/view/gmdl2019/home\">https://sites.google.com/view/gmdl2019/home</a></p>\n<p>In the past few years deep learning has emerged as a common approach to learning data-driven representations.  While deep learning approaches have attained remarkable performance improvements in many 2D vision tasks, such as image classification and object detection, they cannot be directly applied to geometric vision problems due to the fundamental differences between 2D and 3D vision tasks, such as the non-Euclidean nature of geometric objects, higher dimensionality, and the lack of large-scale annotated 3D datasets.  Designing geometric components and constraints to improve the performance of deep neural networks is a promising direction worth further exploration. The workshop aims to bring together experts from both the geometric vision and deep learning areas to summarize recent advances, exchange ideas, and inspire new directions.</p>\n","authors":[],"date":"Sat Sep 28 2019 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","lastmod":"Sat Sep 28 2019 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)"},"__N_SSG":true}

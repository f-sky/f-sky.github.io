These projects develop key technologies for many AI applications such as <strong>robotics, autonomous driving, augmented reality and medical image analysis</strong>.</p>\n<p>Besides academic training and hardware/computing resources, we will provide a variety of opportunities including publishing papers in top conferences &#x26; journals (CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, T-PAMI), collaborating with research groups in top oversea universities (e.g. UPenn, UT Austin) and internship at well-known research labs in industry (e.g. SenseTime, Alibaba, Google), <strong>all of which we hope will prepare you for a research career in AI related areas</strong>.</p>\n<p>You will also have the opportunity to work with a group of the most talented and diligent students at ZJU, most of which are from the CKC Honors College and winners of the National Scholarship.</p>\n<p>Please send your resume to <a href=\"mailto:xzhou@cad.zju.edu.cn\"><em>xzhou@cad.zju.edu.cn</em></a> if you are interested.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/group.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n","authors":[],"date":"Tue Mar 10 2020 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","lastmod":"Sat Dec 28 2019 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)"},"__N_SSG":true}
